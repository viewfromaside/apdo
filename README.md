# 😵 I spent 2 weeks on this... why did I do this to myself?

Welcome to my **highly customizable Notepad project**.  
Yes, I know… nobody asked for it.  
Yes, it consumed way too many hours of my life.  
And yes, I kinda love it. ❤️

---

## ✨ Features
- Fully customizable notes (because the default notepads are boring)
- Clean and minimal interface (sometimes)
- Built with technologies that also kept me awake at night
- Designed for people who want a notepad that *finally adapts to them*

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js + TailwindCSS + Framer Motion  
- **Backend:** Gin (Go) + Firebase  
- **Other magic:** Jotai, ESLint, and too much caffeine

---

## 🚧 Work in Progress
This project is still evolving.  
Things I still want to add:
- Authentication improvements 🔑
- API integrations 🌐
- Smarter search for notes 🔍

---

## 🤔 Why?
Honestly? I just wanted to see how far I could push the idea of a customizable notepad.  
Also… because I apparently hate myself and enjoy overcomplicating things.
